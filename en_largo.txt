It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. We had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.

Once upon a time, in a quiet English village, there lived a man who spent his days reading ancient books and walking along the river. His house was full of papers, maps, and curious objects he had collected during his travels. Every morning he would sit near the window and watch the fog rising slowly over the hills, covering everything in a soft grey blanket.

The people in the village knew him well, although few had ever spoken to him for long. Some thought he was a scholar, others believed he had once been a sailor who had crossed the oceans and survived storms no ordinary man could face. He simply smiled at their stories and continued living his peaceful life, never worried by what others imagined about him.

Day after day the seasons changed, and the man grew older, but his love for learning never left him. New children in the town would often ask about the mysterious old gentleman who lived near the river, and the adults had no clear answer. They only said he had always been there, like the hills and the river itself.
